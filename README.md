This script is used for RAW qPCR and western blot data from plates (structure western blot in the plates) (specifically for toxicology studies but may be used for other use cases) to output into graphs. 
Setup for script uses 3 csv files per plate in a plate folder
  1. wellmap indicating chemical used for sample
  2. wellmap indicating gene primer used per well
  3. wellmap indicating CT values outputted by qPCR machiene
example of input and output graphs are included in repo
